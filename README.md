## ðŸ˜· Face Mask Detection
A simple deep learning project that detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Upload an image and get instant prediction.  
- Lightweight and easy to run locally.  
- Displays probabilities for both classes (**Mask**, **No Mask**).  

---

## ðŸ§  Model
- Built with **TensorFlow / Keras**.  
- **CNN** with 4 convolutional layers: 32, 64, 128, 256 filters.  
- Includes:  
  - ReLU activation  
  - Batch Normalization  
  - MaxPooling  
  - Dropout (to reduce overfitting)  
- Final Dense layer with **Sigmoid** for binary classification.  
- Achieved **~96% accuracy** on the test set.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Trained on [Kaggle Face Mask Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset).  
- Two classes:  
  - **With Mask ðŸ˜·**  
  - **Without Mask ðŸ™‚**
